## To Do
To-Do list for this resource pack
- Different growth stages Nether Wart
  - Makes it easier visible for each growth stage
- Piston back visibility
  - Add a brown dot on the back of a normal piston and a green one on a sticky piston one so you can easily see the difference
- Inventory only/Always durability shower 
  - Still need to decide whether it should be useful only in hud screen or also in inventory and whether it is possible
- UI Tweaks
  - Allows you to toggle HUD, Perspective, Paper Doll, Durability Bar, Compass and Clock
- Quick craft book in crafting
  - Instead of having only a green box, as well a Crafting Book
  - Not much priority, but something to work on
- Make 1.16.40 compatible
  - Currently crashes in that version
- Flipbook disabler
  - Probably disable only the most laggy particles/block flipbooks
